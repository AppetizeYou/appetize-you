# **Appetize You**

## **Purpose**

"Turn crisis into an opportunity."

COVID-19 has highly impacted sole proprietors. However, those with a strong conviction found or are finding a new opprotunity through the crisis.

The enhancement of the independent media industry brought a new possibility to the world.

Youna Kang, AKA CodeMiko, is a full time Twitch streamer and YouTuber who is formally a 3D designer and moved to Los Angelos in 2020 as she found a new job at the new studio. Unfortunately, COVID-19 stroke the world in 2020 and she was the one who has been laid off from the studio. With the thought of it being the last, Youna brought her skill as a formal 3D designer and technician to the independent media industry, created a virtual character named CodeMiko and has 434K subscribers on YouTube and 917K followers on Twitch.

Such flow has also opened a new pathway for the food industry. Food experts, chefs, culinary researchers, etc. are joining the battle and started to share their recipe on the media. Most of them are sharing their recipes on YouTube with written details on video description section or on comments. Those of who already have huge fan bases might have their own website or a blog, but new starters might have difficulties to afford a budget to maintain their website, etc and that is why we came up with the idea of *Appetize You*.
